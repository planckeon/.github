## What We Build

We develop intelligent, high-performance software tools that accelerate research in theoretical physics—with a focus on quantum gravity. Our work bridges the gap between cutting-edge physical theory and practical computational implementation.

## Featured Projects

| Repository | Description | Language |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| [**autograv**](https://github.com/planckeon/autograv) | Numerical relativity meets automatic differentiation | JAX/Python |
| [**pauliz**](https://github.com/planckeon/pauliz) | Zero-dependency quantum computing simulation | Zig |
| [**attn-as-bilinear-form**](https://github.com/planckeon/attn-as-bilinear-form) | Transformer attention via tensor calculus & differential geometry | Research |

## Why "Planckeon"?

Our name comes from **planckeons**—theoretical entities at the Planck scale (~10⁻³⁵ m) where quantum mechanics and gravity merge. Recent research models them as the fundamental "grains" of spacetime, realizing the **ER=EPR conjecture** through networks of quantum wormholes.

Just as planckeons bridge the quantum and gravitational realms, we build software that bridges theoretical physics and practical computation.
